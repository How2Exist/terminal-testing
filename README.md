# terminal-testing
a coding game i'm making for a school project

here's some practices:
- if the scene is used for a test or is the only scene, name it "mainScene"
- try to always name the GameManager "gm"
- for any important comment, use "========" before and after the actual comment
- - it just looks nicer
